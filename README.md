## How to Run the code

1. Clone this to your local
2. Change the directory to your directory in PowerShell
3. Type Uvicorn main:app (because i path the FastApi() to app variable and the .py file named main.py)
4. If you want to run with docker, check the dockerfile and change the port, etc with your preferences
5. Don't forget to contribute with pull requests if u see any problem
